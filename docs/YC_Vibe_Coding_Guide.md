## Planning Process

- **Create a comprehensive plan**: Start by working with the AI to write a detailed implementation plan in a markdown file
- **Review and refine**: Delete unnecessary items, mark features as "won't do" if too complex
- **Maintain scope control**: Keep a separate section for "ideas for later" to stay focused
- **Implement incrementally**: Work section by section rather than attempting to build everything at once
- **Track progress**: Have the AI mark sections as complete after successful implementation
- **Commit regularly**: Ensure each working section is committed to Git before moving to the next

---

## Version Control Strategies

- **Use Git religiously**: Don't rely solely on the AI tools' revert functionality
- **Start clean**: Begin each new feature with a clean Git slate
- **Reset when stuck**: Use `git reset --hard HEAD` if the AI goes on a "vision quest"
- **Avoid cumulative problems**: Multiple failed attempts create layers and layers of bad code
- **Clean implementation**: When you finally find a solution, reset and implement it cleanly

---

## Testing Framework

- **Prioritize high-level tests**: Focus on end-to-end integration tests over unit tests
- **Simulate user behavior**: Test features by simulating someone clicking through the site/app
- **Catch regressions**: LLMs often make unnecessary changes to unrelated logic
- **Test before proceeding**: Ensure tests pass before moving to the next feature
- **Use tests as guardrails**: Some founders recommend starting with test cases to provide clear boundaries

---

## Effective Bug Fixing

- **Leverage error messages**: Simply copy-pasting error messages is often enough for the AI
- **Analyze before coding**: Ask the AI to consider multiple possible causes
- **Reset after failures**: Start with a clean slate after each unsuccessful fix attempt
- **Implement logging**: Add strategic logging to better understand what's happening
- **Switch models**: Try different AI models when one gets stuck
- **Clean implementation**: Once you identify the fix, reset and implement it on a clean codebase

---

## AI Tool Optimization

- **Create instruction files**: Write detailed instructions for your AI in appropriate files (`cursor.rules`, `windsurf.rules`, `claude.md`)
- **Local documentation**: Download API documentation to your project folder for accuracy
- **Use multiple tools**: Some founders run both Cursor and Windsurf simultaneously on the same project
- **Tool specialization**: Cursor is a bit faster for frontend work, while Windsurf thinks longer
- **Compare outputs**: Generate multiple solutions and pick the best one

---

## Complex Feature Development

- **Create standalone prototypes**: Build complex features in a clean codebase first
- **Use reference implementations**: Point the AI to working examples to follow
- **Clear boundaries**: Maintain consistent external APIs while allowing internal changes
- **Modular architecture**: Service-based architectures with clear boundaries work better than monorepos

---

## Tech Stack Considerations

- **Established frameworks excel**: Ruby on Rails works well due to 20 years of consistent conventions
- **Training data matters**: Newer languages like Rust or Elixir may have less training data
- **Modularity is key**: Small, modular files are easier for both humans and AIs to work with
- **Avoid large files**: Don't have files that are thousands of lines long

---

## Beyond Coding

- **DevOps automation**: Use AI for configuring servers, DNS, and hosting
- **Design assistance**: Generate favicons and other design elements
- **Content creation**: Draft documentation and marketing materials
- **Educational tool**: Ask the AI to explain implementations line by line
- **Use screenshots**: Share UI bugs or design inspiration visually
- **Voice input**: Tools like Aqua enable 140 words per minute input

---

## Continuous Improvement

- **Regular refactoring**: Once tests are in place, refactor frequently
- **Identify opportunities**: Ask the AI to find refactoring candidates
- **Stay current**: Try every new model release
- **Recognize strengths**: Different models excel at different tasks
